  abstract = {We introduce a refractive radiative transfer equation to the graphics community for the physically based rendering of participating media that have a spatially varying index of refraction. We review principles of geometric nonlinear optics that are crucial to discuss a more generic light transport equation. In particular, we present an optical model that has an integral form suitable for rendering. We show rigorously that the continuous bending of light rays leads to a nonlinear scaling of radiance. To obtain physically correct results, we build on the concept of basic radiance—known from discontinuous refraction—to conserve energy in such complex media. Furthermore, the generic model accounts for the reduction in the speed of light due to the index of refraction to render transient effects like the propagation of light echoes. We solve the refractive volume rendering equation by extending photon mapping with transient light transport in a refractive, participating medium. We demonstrate the impact of our approach on the correctness of rendered images of media that are dominated by spatially continuous refraction and multiple scattering. Furthermore, our model enables us to render visual effects like the propagation of light echoes or time-of-flight imagery that cannot be produced with previous approaches.},

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

User-controlled changes of lighting positions only require a few seconds of update time. Our method is based on a set of ordinary differential equations derived from the eikonal equation, the main postulate of geometric optics. This set of equations allows for fast casting of bent light rays with the complexity of a particle tracer. Based on this concept, we also propose an efficient light propagation technique using adaptive wavefront tracing. Efficient GPU implementations for our algorithmic concepts enable us to render a combination of visual effects that were previously not reproducible in real-time.},

This overcomes the problem, and the algorithm is still very fast because we are using linear approximation outside these small but important areas.

For steady velocity fields, a streamline is the trace of a particle, and a stream surface is the trace of a curve. Here a new method is presented for the construction of stream surfaces. The central concept is the representation of a stream surface as an implicit surface f (x) = C. After the initial calculation of f a family of stream surfaces can be generated efficiently by varying C. The shapes of the originating curves are defined by the value of f at the boundary. Two techniques are presented for the calculation of f: one based on solving the convection equation, the other on backward tracing of the trajectories of grid points. The flow around objects is discussed separately. With this method irregular topologies of the originating curves and of the stream surfaces can be handled easily. Further, it can also be used for other visualization techniques, such as time surfaces and stream volumes. Finally, an effective method for the automatic placement of originating curves is presented.{$<>$}},

Bent rays are approximated by polygonal lines that are represented by textures. Ray integration is based on an iterative numerical solution of ordinary differential equations whose initial values are determined during ray setup. To improve the rendering performance, we propose acceleration techniques such as early ray termination and adaptive ray integration.

We simulate the thermal flow dynamics that models the air flow interacting with the heat by a hybrid thermal lattice Boltzmann model (HTLBM). The computational approach couples a multiple-relaxation-time LBM (MRTLBM) with a finite difference discretization of a standard advectiondiffusion equation for temperature. In heat shimmering and mirage, the changes in the index of refraction of the surrounding air are attributed to temperature variation. A nonlinear ray tracing method is used for rendering. Interactive performance is achieved by accelerating the computation of both the MRTLBM and the heat transfer, as well as the rendering on contemporary graphics hardware (GPU).},
