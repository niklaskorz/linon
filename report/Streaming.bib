  abstract = {Abstract â€” In this paper, we consider a real-time MPEG-4 streaming architecture to facilitate remote visualization of large scale 3D models on thin clients, which denote most of the hand-held devices that have limited computing resources. MPEG-4 serves as a key component to handle the compression, transmission, and visualization of the high-end supercomputer rendered image sequence, allowing the synchronization of the data in both the terminal and the server. The MPEG-4 encoding speed is thus the bottleneck of the system, in particular, the motion estimation process takes more than half of the total encoding time. We propose a fast motion estimation algorithm that expedites the MPEG-4 encoding process. Our algorithm utilizes the 3D data available at the server and is able to directly calculate the motion vector on a block basis without having to employ the expensive MPEG motion searching procedure. In addition, our algorithm can be implemented on the Graphic Processor Units(GPUs) such that most of the motion estimation process can be done in parallel to the encoding process. Our preliminary results show that the proposed motion estimation is able to significantly speed up the encoding process while maintaining the encoding quality. I.},

The framework aims at creating a networked game platform for home and hotel environments. A local PC based server executes a computer game and streams the graphical output to local devices in the rooms, such that the users can play everywhere in the network. Since delay is extremely crucial in interactive gaming, efficient encoding and caching of the commands is necessary. In our system we also address the round trip time problem of commands requiring feedback from the graphics board by simulating the graphics state at the server. This results in a system that enables interactive game play over the network.},

  abstract = {Mobile devices such as personal digital assistants, tablet PCs, and cellular phones have greatly enhanced user capability to connect to remote resources. Although a large set of applications is now available bridging the gap between desktop and mobile devices, visualization of complex 3D models is still a task hard to accomplish without specialized hardware. This paper proposes a system where a cluster of PCs, equipped with accelerated graphics cards managed by the Chromium software, is able to handle remote visualization sessions based on MPEG video streaming involving complex 3D models. The proposed framework allows mobile devices such as smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet PCs to visualize objects consisting of millions of textured polygons and voxels at a frame rate of 30 fps or more depending on hardware resources at the server side and on multimedia capabilities at the client side. The server is able to concurrently manage multiple clients computing a video stream for each one; resolution and quality of each stream is tailored according to screen resolution and bandwidth of the client. The paper investigates in depth issues related to latency time, bit rate and quality of the generated stream, screen resolutions, as well as frames per second displayed},

  abstract = {In cloud gaming systems, the game program runs at servers in the cloud, while clients access game services by sending input events to the servers and receiving game scenes via video streaming. In this paradigm, servers are responsible for all performance-intensive operations, and thus suffer from poor scalability. An alternative paradigm is called graphics streaming, in which graphics commands and data are offloaded to the clients for local rendering, thereby mitigating the server's burden and allowing more concurrent game sessions. Unfortunately, this approach is bandwidth-consuming, due to large amounts of graphic commands and geometry data. In this paper, we present LiveRender, an open-source gaming system that remedies the problem by implementing a suite of bandwidth optimization techniques including intraframe compression, interframe compression, and caching, establishing what we call compressed graphics streaming. Experiments results show that the new approach is able to reduce bandwidth consumption by 52\%-73\% compared to raw graphics streaming, with no perceptible difference in video quality and reduced response delay. Compared to the video streaming approach, LiveRender achieves a traffic reduction of 40\%-90\% with even improved video quality and substantially smaller response delay, while enabling higher concurrency at the server.},

Though cloud computing and virtualization technology has been widely applied in supporting the information processing needs of conventional enterprise and business applications, there has been little success to-date in enabling realtime 3D virtual appliances in the cloud. This paper aims to address this deficiency by presenting SHARC, a solution for enabling scalable support of realtime 3D applications in a cloud computing environment. The solution uses a scalable pipelined processing infrastructure which consists of three processing networks according to the principle of division-of-labor, a virtualization server network for running 3D virtual appliances, a graphics rendering network for processing graphics rendering workload with load balancing, and a media streaming network for transcoding rendered frames into H.264/MPEG-4 media streams and streaming the media streams to a cloud user. The paper describes a prototype implementation of SHARC and reports test results that demonstrate the viability of this approach.},

In a remote walkthrough, a user on a client machine interactively navigates through a scene that resides on a remote server. Our approach allows a user to walk through a remote 3D scene, without ever having to download the entire scene from the server. Our algorithm achieves this by selectively transmitting only small parts of the scene and lower quality representations of objects, based on the user's viewing parameters and the available connection bandwidth. An online optimization algorithm selects which object representations to send, based on the integral of a benefit measure along the predicted path of movement. The rendering quality at the client depends on the available bandwidth, but practical navigation of the scene is possible even when bandwidth is low.},
